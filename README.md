# SlidingPuzzle

This project is an implementation of the 8-tile sliding puzzle and puzzle solver in PyGame. See the Wiki article for how to play: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle.

To run this project, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or just `pip install pygame`), and run the sliding.py file. Use the arrow keys to play the game, or press 's' to use the A* search algorithm to find the optimal solution to the current game state (note this may take up to 30 seconds if the solution requires over 25 moves).

Made using Python and PyGame, and as a cool application of the A* Search Algorithm.
